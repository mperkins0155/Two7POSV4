# Project Summary
The project is a mobile-first, multi-tenant, web-based Point of Sale (POS) platform tailored for small business owners, akin to Square. It functions across web browsers on smartphones, tablets, and computers, offering essential tools for managing sales, tracking orders, and generating reports. Key features include role-based access control, a comprehensive catalog management system, and integration with Helcim for payment processing, enhancing operational efficiency for businesses.

# Project Module Description
The project comprises two main modules:
1. **Frontend Module**: Developed using React, this module facilitates user interactions, including the POS interface, catalog management, and reporting.
2. **Backend Module**: Built with FastAPI, this module oversees data operations, authentication, payment processing, and business logic.

# Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, shadcn-ui
- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- **Payment Processing**: Helcim
- **Development Tools**: Node.js, pnpm

# Usage
## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the backend directory and create the necessary tables using the JSON schema provided in `TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
3. Set up your environment variables for the Helcim integration.

## Running the Application
- Start the backend server using FastAPI.
- Build and run the frontend using `pnpm run build` and `pnpm run dev`.

## Testing
- Run tests for multi-tenant isolation, role-based permissions, and payment flow as outlined in the `QUICK_START.md`.
